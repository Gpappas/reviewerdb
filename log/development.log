Through the articulation lens, the technical communicator can be classified as assuming an authorial role (because they are \"situated in the process of articulating meaning just as prominently as the sender and receiver\"), which has major implications for the level of responsibility for their work technical communicators must assume. This article describes parallels between three progressive models of communication and the changing status and roles of technical communicators. It then makes the case for the field's extension into an authorship role, justified by the understanding of communication through the articulation view, and lists the practical and pedagogical implications/opportunities on technical communication. This article is geared primarily toward technical communication instructors and secondarily toward technical communication practitioners. The briefly touched upon but very important implication of the adoption of authorship among technical communicators is the great ethical responsibilities that would necessarily be assumed by practitioners. The resulting issues would be largely new to the field, and may lead some researchers to adopt an advocacy viewpoint that may contradict industry values.

Through the articulation lens, the technical communicator can be classified as assuming an authorial role (because they are "situated in the process of articulating meaning just as prominently as the sender and receiver"), which has major implications for the level of responsibility for their work technical communicators must assume. This article describes parallels between three progressive models of communication and the changing status and roles of technical communicators. It then makes the case for the field''s extension into an authorship role, justified by the understanding of communication through the articulation view, and lists the practical and pedagogical implications/opportunities on technical communication. This article is geared primarily toward technical communication instructors and secondarily toward technical communication practitioners. The briefly touched upon but very important implication of the adoption of authorship among technical communicators is the great ethical responsibilities that would necessarily be assumed by practitioners. The resulting issues would be largely new to the field, and may lead some researchers to adopt an advocacy viewpoint that may contradict industry values.

Because these naturalized biases force individuals outside these borders to identify with dominant groups and disassociate themselves from their own values, the authors argue that students and composition instructors need to be taught to \"recognize computer interfaces as non-innocent physical borders (between the regular world and the virtual world), cultural borders (between the haves and the have-nots), and linguistic borders\" (p. 438). The authors state their assertion that naturalized biases in technology systematically oppress minority and/or disempowered groups, and they then identify the various biases that are naturalized in GUIs and provide examples of how they occur. Finally, the authors advocate instructors adopt a critical approach to computer-based writing, encourage students to do so as well, and provide a number of examples of how instructors might start proactive dialog within the scholarly community and with software development companies.

Because these naturalized biases force individuals outside these borders to identify with dominant groups and disassociate themselves from their own values, the authors argue that students and composition instructors need to be taught to "recognize computer interfaces as non-innocent physical borders (between the regular world and the virtual world), cultural borders (between the haves and the have-nots), and linguistic borders" (p. 438).
